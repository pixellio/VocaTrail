- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library
- **Web Speech API** - Built-in text-to-speech functionality
- **SQLite** - Default server-side database (better-sqlite3)
- **PostgreSQL** - Optional production database with migration support

## Database Configuration

VocaTrail supports both SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL databases with easy migration between them.

### Default (SQLite)
No configuration required. Uses `./data/vocatrail.db` by default.

### PostgreSQL
Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/vocatrail
```

### Migration
```bash
# Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
npm run migrate sqlite-to-postgresql ./data/vocatrail.db postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/vocatrail

# Export/Import data
npm run migrate export-json ./backup/cards.json
npm run migrate import-json ./backup/cards.json
```

See [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md) for detailed configuration and migration instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (optional, for production)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd VocaTrail
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Configuration

VocaTrail uses **SQL.js** as the default database, which provides a WASM-based SQLite implementation that runs entirely in the browser. This means:

- **No server required** - Data is stored locally in the browser
- **Offline functionality** - Works without internet connection
- **Persistent storage** - Data persists between browser sessions
- **SQL compatibility** - Full SQLite feature support

### Environment Variables

You can configure a different database by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Use PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/vocatrail

# Use MySQL
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/vocatrail

# Use SQLite file
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/vocatrail.db

# Force SQL.js usage (default)
USE_SQLJS_DEFAULT=true
```

If no `DATABASE_URL` is provided, the app automatically uses SQL.js as the default database.
