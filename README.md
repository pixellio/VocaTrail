- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library
- **Web Speech API** - Built-in text-to-speech functionality
- **SQLite** - Default server-side database (better-sqlite3)
- **PostgreSQL** - Optional production database with migration support

## Database Configuration

VocaTrail supports both SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL databases with easy migration between them.

### Default (SQLite)
No configuration required. Uses `./data/vocatrail.db` by default.

### PostgreSQL
Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/vocatrail
```

### Migration
```bash
# Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
npm run migrate sqlite-to-postgresql ./data/vocatrail.db postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/vocatrail

# Export/Import data
npm run migrate export-json ./backup/cards.json
npm run migrate import-json ./backup/cards.json
```

See [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md) for detailed configuration and migration instructions.
